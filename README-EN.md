_Emby Fluent Plugin — Carousel enhancement, glassmorphism labels, entry animations (for Chromium-based browsers)_

# Warning: The media library cover is an original design. Please do not imitate it without authorization

---

## Features

- 🎠 **Seamless Carousel** — Homepage banner auto-rotates (10s interval) with clone-frame technique for seamless infinite looping
- ◀▶ **Carousel Navigation** — Hidden prev/next buttons that appear on hover, with debounce protection for rapid clicks
- 🪟 **Glassmorphism Library Labels** — Media library cards show a frosted glass title bar sliding up from the bottom on hover (`backdrop-filter: blur`), replacing the old full-overlay approach
- 🎬 **Entry Animations** — Staggered card entrance animations and logo fade-in effects
- 📦 **Dual Deployment** — Supports both Chrome Extension (Manifest V3) and server-side injection

## Usage Instructions

Library label display mode can be toggled via `--heicha-library-label-mode` in `:root` at the top of `static/css/style.css`:

- `always` — Always visible at reduced opacity, brighter on hover **(default)**
- `hover` — Only visible on mouse hover
- `none` — Completely hidden

## Usage Method

**Two methods — only need to deploy one**

> Plugin Version

_Requires users to load the extension (Chrome 88+ required for Manifest V3)_

Chrome Extension Settings > Developer Mode > Load the unzipped extension > Select the source code directly

> Server Version

_No need to use plugins, deploy directly to the server, users can use it seamlessly_
